# Plan VLA Module 4

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Plan-VLA-Module-4" --stage "plan" --feature "003-vla-integration"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with all required planning artifacts including research, data model, quickstart guide, and documentation contract.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created complete planning documentation for Vision-Language-Action educational module covering voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based cognitive planning, and capstone autonomous humanoid integration for CS students.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Specification validated against quality checklist with all items passing.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and documentation-contract.yaml for Module 4 planning.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Proceed to task breakdown with /sp.tasks
2. Begin implementation of Isaac Sim fundamentals content
3. Create supporting materials and examples

## REFLECTION_NOTE

The planning provides a solid foundation for advanced LLM-robotics integration education using Vision-Language-Action frameworks.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - planning completed successfully with all quality criteria met.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Planning was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

The planning successfully defines Module 4 implementation approach covering voice-to-action pipelines with Whisper, LLM-based cognitive planning, and end-to-end autonomous humanoid integration.
