# Plan Isaac AI Brain Module

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Plan-Isaac-AI-Brain-Module" --stage "plan" --feature "002-isaac-ai-brain"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) with all required planning artifacts.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created complete planning documentation for Isaac-based AI robotics education module covering simulation, perception, and navigation for humanoid robots.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Specification validated against quality checklist with all items passing.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and documentation-contract.yaml for Module 3 planning.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Proceed to task breakdown with /sp.tasks
2. Begin implementation of Isaac Sim fundamentals content
3. Create supporting materials and examples

## REFLECTION_NOTE

The planning provides a solid foundation for advanced robotics education using NVIDIA Isaac platform with clear technical approach and architecture.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - planning completed successfully with all quality criteria met.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Planning was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

The planning successfully defines Module 3 implementation approach covering Isaac Sim fundamentals, perception with Isaac ROS, and Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots.
