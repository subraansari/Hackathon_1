# Implement Isaac Module 3

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Implement-Isaac-Module-3" --stage "green" --feature "002-isaac-ai-brain"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully implemented Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) with complete educational content covering Isaac Sim fundamentals, Isaac ROS perception and localization, and Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created comprehensive educational module for NVIDIA Isaac-based AI robotics covering simulation, perception, and navigation for humanoid robots with all content properly integrated into the Docusaurus site.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Docusaurus site builds successfully with all Module 3 content integrated and navigation properly configured.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created 7 content files and updated sidebar navigation for Module 3: index.md, isaac-sim-fundamentals.md, isaac-ros-perception-localization.md, navigation-with-nav2.md, isaac-sim-installation.md, dependencies.md, and created isaac assets directory.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Deploy the updated site to production
2. Review content for technical accuracy
3. Plan Module 4 implementation

## REFLECTION_NOTE

Module 3 implementation provides students with comprehensive understanding of Isaac-based AI robotics including simulation, perception, and navigation systems for humanoid robots.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - all content properly created and integrated successfully.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Implementation was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) has been successfully implemented with all required content covering Isaac Sim fundamentals, Isaac ROS perception and localization, and Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots.
