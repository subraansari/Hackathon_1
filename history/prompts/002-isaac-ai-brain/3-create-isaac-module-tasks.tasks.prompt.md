# Create Isaac Module Tasks

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Create-Isaac-Module-Tasks" --stage "tasks" --feature "002-isaac-ai-brain"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created comprehensive implementation tasks for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) with detailed task breakdown organized by user stories.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created complete task breakdown for Isaac-based AI robotics education module with 52 detailed tasks organized across 6 phases covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robots.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Task validation completed successfully with all tasks properly formatted and organized by user stories.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created tasks.md file with 52 detailed tasks organized across 6 phases for Module 3 implementation.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Proceed to implementation with /sp.implement
2. Begin Phase 1: Setup tasks for Isaac AI Brain module
3. Create supporting materials and examples

## REFLECTION_NOTE

The task breakdown provides clear roadmap for implementing advanced robotics education content using NVIDIA Isaac platform.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - all tasks properly formatted with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels as required.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Task generation was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

The task breakdown successfully organizes all required work for Module 3 into implementable chunks with proper prioritization and clear dependencies between user stories.
