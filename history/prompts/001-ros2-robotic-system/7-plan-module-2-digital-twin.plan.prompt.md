# Plan Module 2 Digital Twin

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Plan-Module-2-Digital-Twin" --stage "plan" --feature "001-ros2-robotic-system"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the complete implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), including all required planning artifacts: implementation plan, research summary, data model, quickstart guide, and documentation contract.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created a comprehensive plan for the digital twin educational module covering physics simulation with Gazebo, sensor simulation, and high-fidelity environments with Unity. All planning artifacts are in place to guide implementation of this educational content for CS students learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Docusaurus site builds successfully with all new content integrated and navigation properly configured.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created 5 planning artifacts for Module 2: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and documentation-contract.yaml in the contracts directory.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Generate tasks for implementing Module 2 content
2. Begin implementation of physics simulation with Gazebo content
3. Create Unity integration examples and documentation

## REFLECTION_NOTE

The planning phase established a solid foundation for the digital twin module with comprehensive documentation of requirements, structure, and implementation approach.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - all planning artifacts created successfully and follow the constitutional principles.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Planning was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

The planning work successfully created all required artifacts for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), establishing clear direction for implementation of educational content covering physics simulation, sensor simulation, and Unity integration for humanoid robotics education.
