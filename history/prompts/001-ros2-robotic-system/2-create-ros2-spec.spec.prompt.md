# Creation of ROS 2 Robotic System Specification

## PROMPT_TEXT
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Target audience:
- CS students learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Focus:
- ROS 2 as middleware connecting AI logic to humanoid robots

Chapters (Docusaurus):
1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
   - Nodes, topics, services, actions
   - ROS 2 architecture for robots

2. Python Agents with rclpy
   - Writing ROS 2 nodes in Python
   - Connecting AI/agent logic to controllers

3. Humanoid Modeling with URDF
   - Links, joints, sensors
   - Structure of humanoid robots in ROS 2

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Successfully created the specification for "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)". The specification includes three prioritized user stories: (1) ROS 2 Fundamentals Learning (P1), (2) Python Agent Development (P2), and (3) Humanoid Robot Modeling (P3). Nine functional requirements were defined covering educational modules, hands-on exercises, Python-based examples, and URDF modeling. Six success criteria were established focusing on student learning outcomes. The specification is technology-agnostic where appropriate and ready for the planning phase. A quality checklist was also created and all validation items passed.

## OUTCOME
The ROS 2 robotic system specification has been successfully created with all required sections completed. The specification is comprehensive and aligned with the user's requirements for an educational module targeting CS students learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## EVALUATION
The specification meets all quality criteria with testable requirements, measurable success criteria, and clear user scenarios. All checklist items have been validated as complete, confirming the specification is ready for the planning phase.
