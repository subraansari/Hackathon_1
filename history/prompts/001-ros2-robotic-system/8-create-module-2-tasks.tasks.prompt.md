# Create Module 2 Tasks

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Create-Module-2-Tasks" --stage "tasks" --feature "001-ros2-robotic-system"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created comprehensive implementation tasks for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), organizing them by user stories with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Created a complete task breakdown for the digital twin educational module covering physics simulation with Gazebo, sensor simulation, and high-fidelity environments with Unity. Tasks are organized in priority order with clear dependencies and independent test criteria for each user story.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Docusaurus site builds successfully with all content integrated and navigation properly configured.

## FILES_SUMMARY

Created tasks.md file with 52 detailed tasks organized across 6 phases for Module 2 implementation.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Begin implementation of Phase 1: Setup tasks
2. Implement physics simulation content for Gazebo (US1)
3. Create supporting materials and examples

## REFLECTION_NOTE

The task breakdown provides clear roadmap for implementing Module 2 with appropriate prioritization and dependencies between user stories.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - all tasks properly formatted with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels as required.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Task generation was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

The task breakdown successfully organizes all required work for Module 2 into implementable chunks with proper prioritization and clear dependencies between user stories.
