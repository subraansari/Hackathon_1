# Complete Module 2 Implementation

## PROMPT_TEXT

--title "Complete-Module-2-Implementation" --stage "green" --feature "001-ros2-robotic-system"

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully verified that Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) has been completely implemented with all content files created and properly integrated into the Docusaurus site.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT

Module 2 educational content is fully implemented with comprehensive coverage of physics simulation with Gazebo, sensor simulation, and high-fidelity environments with Unity. All content is properly integrated into the navigation structure and the site builds successfully.

## TESTS_SUMMARY

Docusaurus site builds successfully with all Module 2 content integrated and navigation properly configured.

## FILES_SUMMARY

All Module 2 content files created and integrated: index.md, physics-simulation-with-gazebo.md, sensor-simulation.md, high-fidelity-environments-with-unity.md, with sidebar navigation updated and tasks marked as completed.

## NEXT_PROMPTS

1. Deploy the updated site to production
2. Review content for technical accuracy
3. Plan Module 3 implementation

## REFLECTION_NOTE

Module 2 implementation is comprehensive and well-structured, providing students with a complete learning path for digital twin technology in robotics.

## FAILURE MODES OBSERVED

None observed - all content properly created and integrated successfully.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT TO IMPROVE PROMPT QUALITY

N/A - Implementation was successful as requested.

## EVALUATION

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) has been successfully implemented with all required content covering physics simulation, sensor simulation, and Unity integration for humanoid robotics education.
