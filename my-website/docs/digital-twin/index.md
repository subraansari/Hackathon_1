# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
- Set up and configure physics-based simulations with Gazebo
- Integrate sensor simulation for realistic robot perception
- Create high-fidelity environments using Unity
- Connect simulation environments to ROS 2 for seamless operation

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)! This module focuses on the creation and utilization of digital twins for humanoid robots. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical robot that allows for testing, validation, and development in a simulated environment before deployment on real hardware.

Digital twins play a crucial role in robotics development by providing:
- Safe testing environment without risk to hardware
- Faster iteration and development cycles
- Cost-effective validation of algorithms
- Training opportunities for robot operators

This module will guide you through the process of creating realistic simulations using industry-standard tools like Gazebo and Unity, and connecting them to your ROS 2 system for comprehensive robot development and testing.
