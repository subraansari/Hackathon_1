# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Implement perception and localization systems using Isaac ROS
- Create navigation systems with Nav2 for humanoid robots
- Integrate simulation with real-world robotics applications

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)! This module focuses on advanced robotics concepts using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, which provides state-of-the-art tools for robotics simulation, perception, and navigation. The Isaac platform enables the development of AI-powered robotic systems with photorealistic simulation capabilities, hardware-accelerated perception, and sophisticated navigation systems.

This module is structured around three core areas:
1. Isaac Sim fundamentals for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. Isaac ROS for perception and localization using hardware-accelerated VSLAM
3. Navigation with Nav2 specifically tailored for humanoid robots

## Target Audience
